### PowerCommands ðŸ’¿
Donwload the latest version of `PowerCommands` and enjoy a bunch of linux and custom commands for windows.

## Instalation
Once you have downloaded the zip, unzip it and put it in a folder that will not be touched.

Next you have to add a `path` enviroment variable pointing to `path/to/your/folder/bin` In my case i have this path for the enviroment variable.


```
C:\PowerCommands\bin
```

Where the `\bin` folder is where the scripts and the configuration must be.

Now restart your computer to apply the enviroment variable and enjoy the commands in your terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> Take a look at the [ConfigFile](https://github.com/d4nilpzz/PowerCommands/blob/main/bin/README.md) and how to change values in it.
